# Brainfuck interpreter in Python

Well, the title says it all. I tried to follow a more object-oriented style here to avoid nasty "if elif elif" code.

In case you don't know the language (good! This means that you have a life), check out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck

## How to use it

`python brainfuck.py example.bf`

Debug mode:

`python brainfuck.py example.bf --debug`<br>
`python brainfuck.py example.bf -d`
